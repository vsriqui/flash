# Flashcard-Test Project

## Abstract:

I built an app for playing with flash cards in terminal. Users, can select answers in terminal using the corresponding numbers. The app also tracks incorrect answers and reports on your correct percentage at the end of the game.

## Installation Instructions:
1. Fork this repository.
2. `cd` into the desired directory.
3. Clone it down to your machine using `git clone git@github.com:vsriqui/Rock-Paper-Scissors.git`.
4. `cd` into the created directory.
5. Run `node index.js` in terminal.

## Context:

The project was assigned in week 1 of Turing Module 2, and I was given 4 days to finish the project. I likely spent 6-7 hours on the coding aspects of it, perhaps 1-2 researching. It was a fun project, and I quite enjoyed it.

## Learning Goals:

- Learning how to write tests before implementing code to explore test driven development concepts
- Learning how to manage code across multiple files.
- Learning how to work within code that isn't full implemented.

## Wins + Challenges:

I would say the main challenge was getting more confortable and organic off of writing code from tests. I would say the main win was getting it to work.
